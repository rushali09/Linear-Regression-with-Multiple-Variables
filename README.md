# Linear-Regression-with-Multiple-Variables

In this project, I have learnt on how to predict house prices with multiple variables using linear regression model. I have attached the code and dataset in this repository for references. This mini-project is a part of my Machine learning journey to help me understand the basics and implement my knowledge at the same time.
